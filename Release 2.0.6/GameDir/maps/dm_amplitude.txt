Installation
------------

Unzip the file dm_amplitude.bsp into :
Steam\Steamapps\[your username]\half-life 2 deathmatch\hl2mp\maps\


Info
----
This is a classic deathmatch map without a realistic theme. It rather focuses on good connectivity and fast paced gameplay. The size of the map got rather large so I suggest at least 6 players on a server.


Special Thanks

I'd like to thank the guys at Snarkpit who gave me hints where the map still had to be improved and what was missing.

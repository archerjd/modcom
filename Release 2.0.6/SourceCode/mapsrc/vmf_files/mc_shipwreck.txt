so, the map isn't compiled - hammer issues, but one thing at a time.

take a look at it, lemme know if you think the idea seems alright, any any suggested changes, i suppose can go here.

as for the map itself, you'll see the basic ground layout of the riverbed, with some gouges in it, where water will be.
    as well as the overturned ship, it's cabin, storage area, and more detail later on.
    there are shipping containers strewn insie the ship, and later on there will be many all over the battlefield and such, but for now keeping it clean to see.
    lastly, there is an example of containers which will be speared into the ground, a small block of land raised up and a mock crater there with the crate inside.
obviously all the detail is far from a finished product, so that's not really the point, mostly the point is seeing if the idea is, a good idea.
